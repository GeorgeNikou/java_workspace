## Restaurant Delivery Application
This was a large team project. Three members assigned with the task to create a full Restaurant delivery application where the user can: 
* Create food items/clients/employees/delivery orders
* Read food items/clients/employees/delivery orders
* Update food items/clients/employees/delivery orders
* Delete food items/clients/employees/delivery orders
* Admin has full access to every action

P.S: One of our members decided an early vacation was due and therefore left the burden of completing this three member project alone. We still managed to pass but were not able to get the delivery service operational.
